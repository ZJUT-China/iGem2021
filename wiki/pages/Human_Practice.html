                        <p class="mg-tb-1 text-little">This year, ZJUT-China aims to innovate RNA detection technology
                            for rapid and accurate detection of RNA using cell-free systems. <strong>To this end, HP's
                                philosophy is to listen to the voices of different social groups to gain inspiration for
                                project development while ensuring the usefulness of the project.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p class="mg-tb-1 text-little">Firstly, we distributed questionnaires to the <strong>general
                                public</strong> to
                            find out what testing technologies are in demand and to clarify what we should work on for
                            our new testing technologies. After that, we interviewed <strong>doctors</strong> as well as
                            <strong>patients</strong> in
                            order to obtain further information about the disease detection technology. With the
                            communication, we have gained a comprehensive knowledge of the existing medical detection
                            systems. We also took the initiative to contact the technical advisor of
                            <strong>GenScript</strong>, a
                            China-based world’s leading <strong>biotech company</strong> providing life sciences
                            services and product, to
                            break through the technical bottleneck. In the process of project R&D, we always remind
                            ourselves to organize and summarize in time. For this purpose, we have established a system
                            of <strong>regular project promotion meetings</strong>. During the meetings, all team
                            members are involved in
                            the discussion of the project progress. This plays a crucial role in the optimization of our
                            projects. We would like to share this working model as a reference for other iGEM teams so
                            that they can carry out their projects more smoothly.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mg-tb-1 text-little">Hp has witnessed the growth of the project through the
                            above-mentioned science communication and is proud to have made outstanding contributions to
                            the formation of the final project. Meanwhile, we are privileged to know that our work is
                            strongly supported by all people and organizations we have come into contact with. We are
                            also very pleased that our results can provide data for other teams.

                                    In the beginning of the project, we didn't have a clear idea of the theme and
                                    content, so we wanted to draw inspiration from everyday life. Cancer is a topic that
                                    no one wants to talk about because it often means death and suffering. Through the
                                    literature, we found that there is a significant correlation between the survival
                                    time of cancer patients and the stage when the cancer is detected, and we can assist
                                    in the diagnosis of cancer <strong>by testing RNA biomarker</strong>.
                                    We focused on the RNA biomarker and found that it is not only associated with
                                    cancer, but also with many inflammatory responses. We have identified some of the
                                    RNA biomarkers mentioned in the current literature that are closely related to
                                    disease occurrence after searching for a large amount of information.

                                    determination to detect RNA biomarker. At the same time, this research helped us to
                                    build a rich database of biomarkers. Hp shared this database with members of the wet
                                    group, who built on it and designed the corresponding igRNAs. <strong>This has led
                                        to a
                                        disease-biomarker-igRNA database, which we hope can be used to develop rapid
                                        detection methods for diseases.</strong>

                                    Through our research, we found that the RNA Biomarker CXCL9 has been identified to
                                    be closely associated with rejection of kidney transplantation, so our team chose
                                    this disease as a research target. A more in-depth study of rejection after kidney

                                    An <strong>online questionnaire</strong> was conducted to investigate the rejection
                                    reaction after
                                    kidney transplantation. The questionnaire was designed to understand the public's
                                    awareness of kidney transplant rejection and the need for testing technology. The
                                    online questionnaire format is not only more in line with the requirements of
                                    epidemic prevention, but also helps us to expand the scope of the survey target and
                                    dissemination. On May 4, 2021, we posted the questionnaire on multiple social media
                                    platforms and received a total of 351 valid questionnaires. Before designing the
                                    online questionnaire, we conducted a study of the available detection technologies.

                                    By analyzing the questionnaire data, we found that <strong>although the general

                                        not new to kidney transplant rejection, they are not aware of the current common
                                        detection methods</strong>. This reminds us that we should present the project
                                    with a simple
                                    knowledge of detection technology. Another thing that caught our attention is that
                                    people tend to focus more on the accuracy of the test when faced with the detection
                                    method. This guided our dry group and wet group to conduct an in-depth study of the
                                    accuracy of the project.

                                    development of clinical detection technology in China. Dr. Lin provided detailed
                                    answers to our questions with his mature clinical experience. He said that the
                                    current kidney biopsy technology in China is well established, but there are still
                                    time and space limitations, as well as a small probability of complications such as
                                    blood in the urine, blood stasis, and infection. <strong>Nowadays, the overall trend

                                        hospital detection technology is from invasive to non-invasive, and our project

                                    On August 30, we conducted a special interview. The interviewee received a
                                    <strong>kidney
                                        transplant</strong> in 2005 at the age of 35. At the time, the <strong>high
                                        cost</strong> of a kidney
                                    transplant left her in debt and nearly broke. Fortunately, her surgery went very
                                    well and she did not have any rejection reactions. However, misfortune befell
                                    another patient. One young man who received a kidney transplant in the same cohort
                                    as she did had a rejection reaction three months after the procedure. He needs to
                                    maintain his infected kidneys by paying for <strong>expensive medications</strong>.
                                    However, the
                                    drugs ultimately failed to save his kidney and he had to wait for the next
                                    transplant. Remarkably, this was a young man from a wealthy family who was able to
                                    pay for his medical expenses and wait for his next kidney transplant. But if the
                                    rejection had occurred in our interviewee, the consequences would undoubtedly have
                                    been catastrophic.

                                graph, whether there are other methods, etc. Dr. Guo, the technical consultant of
                                Genscript, gave a detailed answer to this and explained how to reduce the miss rate of
                                gRNA.In addition, we also have a further understanding of Genscript's related products,
                                several different cas9 proteins, and their related roles, as well as cas12 and Cas13
