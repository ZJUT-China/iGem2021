                        <p class="mg-tb-1 text-little">This year, we successfully continued the good record set by our
                            predecessors and put the safety of ourselves and others at the forefront of our program
                            goals. Ever since the start of our project, safety has always been a priority to the
                            ZJUT-China iGEM team. Before we started, we were trained in safety rules by our teachers in
                            great detail. Only when we passed the exams about lab safety，were we allowed to conduct our
                            experiments in the lab. So，our experiments were designed and operated strictly according to
                            the laboratory safety standards, which includes strict laboratory safety criteria and，most
                            importantly，the safety of bacteria usage during our experiments. The rigorous experimental
                            plans and scrutinous work ethics in the lab cause no harm to the living creatures and the
                            environment in which they live. Dr. Zhang Yinjun is the supervisor of our lab, who is
                            responsible for our lab's security. Before we start our experiments, all our experimental
                            plans were presented to Dr. Zhang Yinjun and Dean’s office in detail. Furthermore, the
                            bio-lab safety officer supervised us frequently, while giving us safety training courses in
                            the laboratory from time to time.

                                lab members who participates in the experiment will receive appropriate training before
                                using the instruments and they will also learn the correct operation of the instruments
                                according to the instructions. Any experiment will be carried out with at least one
                                person present. For the instruments commonly used in the laboratory, the team members
                                sorted out and listed the notes, some of which are shown as follows.
