                        <p class="mg-tb-1 text-little">Through communication, we found that both of our projects needed
                            to transcribe RNA in vitro, which we had little experience in. SYSU-China gave us a lot of
                            suggestions which helped us solved the problem of RNA degradation due to improper operation
                            after in vitro transcription very well. Meanwhile, in our EMSA validation experiment,
                            SYSU-China team suggested that we anneal the RNA to form its secondary structure which made
                            it better to bind to cas9 protein. With their advice, our EMSA experiment was a success!
                            Thanks for SYSU-China's help in our experiment.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mg-tb-1 text-little">We also made some suggestions for the SYSU-China team's RNA
                            design. Initially, we hoped for more collaboration in the experiment and wanted to
                            experimentally verify the RNA of SYSU-China. However, we found that the secondary structure
                            obtained by NUPACK RNA prediction was too complex, and the stem-loop structure formed did
                            not meet the requirements. In addition, through different software analysis, we found that
                            SYSU-China RNA had a stem-loop structure that might affect subsequent experiments. In this
                            regard, SYSU-China took our advice and improved its RNA sequence, and we also helped them
                            complete the prediction of secondary structure.

                        <p class="mg-tb-1 text-little">From August 27 to 29, we participated in the 8th CCiC Conference
                            on Synthetic Biology in Asia. The Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC) is a national
                            summit independently initiated by iGEM teams in China. It aims to provide a platform for
                            participating iGEM teams to share resources and promote mutual learning and communication.
                            While listening to other excellent university programs, we also showed posters and
                            promotional videos of our programs. According to the opinions of the judges and the project
                            sharing of other universities, we received the affirmation of the project from many parties,
                            and also identified the existing shortcomings of the project. Why cas9 proteins in
                            CRISPR/Cas system are used instead of cas12 and Cas13 proteins, which are more suitable for
                            detection, and how to solve the commonly missed target problems of Cas9.This will be the
                            part we need to improve in the subsequent experimental design. During this conference, we
                            were fortunate to communicate with other teams, such as BIT (Beijing Institute of Technology
                            team), to solicit further cooperation.
