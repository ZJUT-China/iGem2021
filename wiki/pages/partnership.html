                                    detailed introduction to the projects of both parties. At the same time, we had a
                                    lot of exchanges on the use of cell-free reagents, and plan to jointly write a
                                    manual for the cell-free system in the future. Both we and XJTLU-CHINA have used the
                                    CRISPR/Cas9 system, so we had more exchanges on gRNA design and in-bacteria
                                    verification. In terms of gRNA design, we lack relevant experience, and the
                                    pre-experimental results after manually selecting a few gRNAs are not good. We
                                    learned that the partners of XJTLU-CHINA use a Geneious software to design crRNA, so
                                    we set our target genes Send it to them and ask them to help design two different

                                    to quantitatively characterize their experimental results. The price of egfp
                                    standard protein is very high, but it happens that our team has egfp standard
                                    protein. After learning their needs, we mailed 1ml (3mg/ml) of egfp standard protein
                                    to XJTLU-CHINA on 8.21. XJTLU-CHIN received our mailed protein on 8.24, measured and
                                    produced their required egfp standard curve based on our egfp standard protein
                                    (Figure 5).

                                        sequence the rest of the sequence is identical, which means we can directly

                                        carried out validation experiments of the reporter element in vitro. In the
                                        Cell-Free system, we found that the system was very sensitive to the
                                        concentration of antibiotics, which required only 0.5 ng/ml to activate the
                                        expression of fluorescence. Interestingly, however, as the antibiotic
                                        concentration in the system increased, the fluorescence expression showed a
                                        decreasing trend, which was exactly the opposite of our expected,
                                        intra-bacterial experiments conducted by OUC-CHINA (Figure 5).

                                    <p class="mg-tb-1 text-little">There exists the phenomenon that the gradient
                                        dependent fluorescence trend may be different(usually opposite) within different
                                        concentration range. We can see from the graph below that the trend in the
                                        second testing point(1 ng/µl) has already opposite to our expectation. One
                                        possible speculation is that the cell free system is ultra-sensitive, and 1
                                        ng/µl of antibiotic has already exceeded the operating range.We can also see
                                        that the fluorescence intensity corresponding to 0ng/µl antibiotic is also 0.
                                        This fact indicated that the basal leakage of our genetic circuit is pretty good
                                        in cell free system. In the future, we would also like to try cell free system
                                        to achieve our goal for it have better basal leakage rate and other adorable
                                        attributes such as controllability and safety. And to further prove the concept,
                                        we have to design more testing point with lower antibiotic concentration
                                        range(at least below 1 ng/µl according to the data ZJUT provided)

                                    interesting biology lesson to the fourth grade children in the form of PPT and
                                    handwork by four team members. Students from ASTWS-China communicated with us, and
                                    eventually we found an education method suitable for the younger age group. It has
                                    been proven that our education methods for the younger age group are effective. The
                                    exchange between the two teams promoted the development of the activity and enriched
                                    our educational experience for the young population.
