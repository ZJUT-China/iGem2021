1
00:03.400 --> 00:05.967
- For patients who received a kidney transplantation,

2
00:06.167 --> 00:09.867
- nearly 30% of them will experience some degree of organ rejection,

3
00:10.133 --> 00:12.500
- which needs a biopsy for further examination.

4
00:13.200 --> 00:17.000
- However, the risks of a kidney biopsy include bleeding and infection.

5
00:17.683 --> 00:22.767
- More importantly, the cost per surgery ranges from $3,000 to $10,000,

6
00:22.983 --> 00:25.000
- which is too high for ordinary families.

7
00:25.700 --> 00:29.733
- Thus, a simple, safe, low-cost diagnostic method is required.

8
00:30.417 --> 00:32.600
- According to literature,

9
00:32.833 --> 00:35.367
- various RNA molecules in urine or blood have proven to serve

10
00:35.367 --> 00:39.283
- as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of various diseases.

11
00:39.967 --> 00:42.500
- Renal transplant rejection is no exception.

12
00:42.867 --> 00:45.933
- Herein, we are developing a cell-free biosensor,

13
00:46.117 --> 00:48.017
- which comprises a cell-free system,

14
00:48.217 --> 00:50.633
- engineered DNA transcription templates

15
00:51.633 --> 00:54.833
- and RNA-responsive CRISPR/Cas9 System.

16
00:55.517 --> 00:58.317
- Once the sensor is exposed to specific RNA,

17
00:58.500 --> 01:02.283
- hybridization between the RNA with the re-engineered gRNA

18
01:02.283 --> 01:04.317
- occurs to releases the targeting region,

19
01:04.600 --> 01:07.917
- leading to the binding between gRNA and its DNA target.

20
01:08.617 --> 01:12.067
- Eventually, the suppression of deGFP get relieved,

21
01:12.100 --> 01:14.800
- following by the increase of fluorescence intensity.

22
01:15.500 --> 01:18.167
- All reagents will be mixed in PCR tubes,

23
01:18.233 --> 01:22.533
- and visible outputs from deGFP can be produced after 16 hours.

24
01:23.217 --> 01:27.517
- With an illuminator, the fluorescence outputs can be visualized by naked eyes.

25
01:28.217 --> 01:32.017
- Consisting of LEDs, PCR tube holders, a light filter

26
01:32.017 --> 01:35.983
- and a 3D printed case made of biodegradable Polylactic Acid,

27
01:36.283 --> 01:40.100
- the illuminator is designed to be low-cost, recyclable and portable.

28
01:41.800 --> 01:44.933
- Since the additional sequences of gRNA could be completely reprogrammed,

29
01:45.233 --> 01:49.600
- the sensor has potential to detect various RNA biomarkers theoretically,

30
01:49.783 --> 01:54.183
- which means other diseases that use RNA as a biomarker can be diagnosed as well. 

31
01:54.833 --> 01:58.510
- In conclusion, the application of our project is greatly expanded.
